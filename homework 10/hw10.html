<h1>Homework 10: Geoprocessing Analysis </h1>
<h2>Hannah Obenaus</h2>
<h3>The real-world question I attempted to answer using geoprocessing tools was "How is Charleston's Tax Increment Financing (TIF) being used and is the TIF district encroaching upon low-income neighborhoods?" TIFs are a popular economic tool used to catalyze infrastructure development. By catalyzing development that wouldn't normally happen, it increases property value and tax revenue. However, if it is not coupled with affordable housing legislation, it often leads to gentrification. Charleston has been rated one of the fastest-gentrifying cities in the US. Within the past year new apartment complexes and hotels have taken over entire landscapes and communities, especially in low-income areas, as the population continues to boom. To answer this question I downloaded vector layers from the City of Charleston's open data source. I used the clip tool to find which areas in the TIF district (pale yellow) are designated accomodation zones. Accomodation zoning allows for hotel and apartment development. I found that a large fraction of the TIF district overlapped with designated accomodation zones (checkered area). Then I used the clip tool to see which public housing was located in the TIF district (red diamonds), because a large percent of public housing was/is built in low-income areas. I used the difference tool to separate the public housing located outside of the TIF district (blue dots). I found that a large fraction of public housing is already located in the TIF district, or is bordering it. This is what I expected based on what I have seen driving around Charleston. It is very common now to see new luxury hotels and apartments towering next to/or surrounding low-income areas. </h3>
