<h1>Homework 8: Ratios and Categories Education Census Data </h1>
<h2></h2>
<h3>I chose to display the ratio of students (kindegarten - 12th grade) enrolled in private schools to the total population of enrolled students (kindegarten - 12th grade) by county. I created this ratio using 2019 data from the US Census. I inserted a new column into the attribute table, after joining county and census data tables, that divided the private school population by the total population. I then multiplied the quotient by 1000 to make the numbers easy to interpret. I was interested to see which counties had the largest ratio of students enrolled in private schools because South Carolina is ranked #44 in education. This ranking is measured using standardized test scores and public high school graduation rates. There seems to be a correlation between the county's public school district ranking and the ratio of students enrolled in private schools. Calhoun County has a low state ranking for its public school district, and has the highest ratio of private school students. York, Richland, and Lexington County have the top three public school districts in the state and have the lowest ratio interval of private school students. There are 46 counties in South Carolina so I decided to divide the data into 5 classes to create an easy to read map that still displayed variance in the data.</h3>

    <h3>This map shows the data using an equal interval classification scheme. An advnatage of equal interval is that the legend and map are easy to read and understand. However, because this classification divides the data into equal intervals, the map does not always display the data effectively. Just by looking at the shading on this map vs. the one below, you can see there is less variance in color.</h3>

        <h3>This map shows the data using a natural break classification scheme. An advantage of natural breaks is that it recognizes variance in the data and groups data based on its similarities and differences. However, for data that does not have much variance this classification is ineffective. </h3>

    <h3> This map shows the data using a pretty break classification scheme. An advantage of pretty breaks is that the legend and map are visually pleasing. However, if your data does not have much variance, this classification is ineffective. This map has less variance in color than the one above.</h3>
